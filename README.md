A Flask app that helps users voice their opinions on the issues they care about to government officials. 
I had read about the effectiveness of calling your representatives and the importance of state legislators when making policies.
There are so many resources for citizens to analyze political information, but few are as consolidated as LegislatR, which provides information for users to learn about their representatives and issues that Congress and their state legislatures are debating.
I built it using a Flask backend, calling the Google Maps API to return a user's location given an address, and used this information with the Sunlight Congress and Open States APIs to generate information about both legislators and bills.
I developed the frontend using a Bootstrap template and used the Jinja2 template engine with standard HTML.
