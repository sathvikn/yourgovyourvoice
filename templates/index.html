 <h2> Why call your legislators? </h2>
 <p> A phone call to your legislator is the most effective way to make your voice heard in government. You can urge them to support causes you care about, ask them to vote a certain way on legislation, thank or criticize them for their advocacy, and so on. Note that contacting your Congressional representative carries the most weight in federal government. In addition, be sure to contact your state legislators because they make more policies that directly affect you,. Although you may not speak to your legislator directly, a staffer will record your thoughts and notify your legislator about your call. </p>
